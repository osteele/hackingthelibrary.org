## Project Proposal

<i>Due {{ page.parts[1].due_date | date: '%a %b %-d' }}</i>

* Find a team mate(s).
* Jointly select a project based on the provocations from the [Course Book](/files/HtL_web-book-1.pdf).
* Complete the [Mini-Project 2 Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/IVuPuA5de7OflI6m2).


## Part 1

<i>Due {{ page.parts[1].due_date | date: '%a %b %-d' }}</i>

* Demonstrable code in a GitHub repository.
* A five-minute project review presentation.


## Part 2

<i>Due {{ page.parts[2].due_date | date: '%a %b %-d' }}</i>

<i><small>You may stop working on Part 2, regardless of state of completion, after eight hours of out-of-class effort, minus however long the lab work and readings took. (Your total out-of-class time is not required to total more than eight hours.)
If your work is incomplete because you ran out of time, please make this known to me.</small></i>

What to deliver:

Slack or email me the URL of your project repository.

The repository README should answer the questions below, or link to documents that do.

* What is the vision?
* What does the software do? (Including screenshots.)
* How does the code work?
  * How it is organized
  * What is the data flow
  * How to run the code. Installation and usage instructions work on instructor machines. [You may assume Linux and Python 3.]
* Issues and enhancements
  * Known issues
  * Ideas for what to do next
  * Issues and enhancement may be delivered as a text file in your repo, or they can be [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

The big idea is that someone should be able to understand what your project does, and pick up where you left off. (“Someone” could be a future version of yourself.)
